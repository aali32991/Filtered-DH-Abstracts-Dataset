*Explanation*

I applied the following filters to the dh_conferences_works dataset:
- I changed the "conference_year" into the date formate.
- I used the "text filter" on "full_text" to only look for works that include "Python".
- I filterd the "work_type" to include only "workshop/tutorial".
- Finally, I used the "text filter" tool to  refine the "topics" that only include "data mining".
